HMRC database of tax exempt art
============

HMRC-data*.tsv is the most recent file, containing all artworks, post some rudimentary data cleaning and a first attempt to extract artist names from the full text descriptions.

HMRC objects by county (also tab separated) contains limited location data for the objects. This data is stored separately by HMRC. Only the descripton field is common to both tables.

te-art.txt (hash separated) is the original scraped data from the HMRC website

The database contains just over 33,000 works of art in total.
